title: Project Euler Problem 6

### Problem 
From the [problem page](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6):
>Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

### Solution 
This problem is pretty straightforward: calculate the first 100 squared natural numbers 
and square the sum of natural numbers under 100. Then calculate the difference. 

```python
square = 0 #sum of squares of first 100 natural numbers
>>> for i in range(101):
...     A = i*i
...     square += A
...
>>> nat_sum = (100*(101))/2 # sum of natural numbers under 100
>>> nat_sq = nat_sum*nat_sum # square sum of first 100 natural numbers
>>> diff = nat_sq-square 
>>> # diff = 25164150
```
