title: Project Euler Problem 7

### Problem 
From the [problem page](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7): 
>What is the 10001st prime number?

### Solution 
The problem requires that at least 10001 primes are found, and [generating primes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generating_primes)
can be done efficiently using sieve methods. A classic prime generating algorithm is the Sieve of Eratosthenes, as it is easy 
to implement. 

Thus, the problem is solved by generating over 10000 primes and finding the 10001th element. 
This is my solution in Scala: 

```scala 
import scala.math._
// Generating primes using the Sieve of Eratosthenes 
def sieve_Eratosthenes(n: BigInt): Vector[BigInt] = {
  val lim = (ceil(sqrt(n.toInt))+1).toInt
  var primes: Vector[BigInt] = Vector.range(2,n)
  var index = 0
  var P = primes(index) // prime number P
  while (P < lim) {
    primes = primes.filter(i => i % P != 0)
    primes = P+:primes 
    index += 1 
    P = primes(index)
    }
  return primes.sorted
}
val primes = sieve_Eratosthenes(150000)
val ans = primes(10000)
// ans = 104743
```
