title: Bioinformatics and Rosalind
--- 
Over the last month, I've started exploring the bioinformatics learning platform, [Rosalind](http://rosalind.info/about/). Rosalind 
strives to offer a platform to learn bioinformatics through problem solving. I'm creating my Rosalind solutions in Scala and am trying to
minimize the use of preexisting bioinformatics packages. Instead, I'm building my bioinformatics tools from the ground up. 

I work on solutions on [my ROSALIND github repository](https://github.com/kienma/ROSALIND).
