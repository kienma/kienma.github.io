title: Project Euler Problem 9 
--- 

### Problem 
From the [problem page](https://projecteuler.net/problem=9):
> There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which *a + b + c = 1000*.
> Find the product *abc*.

### Solution 
Due to the condition *a + b + c = 1000*, the problem can be approached using an exhaustive search. First, however, Pythagorean triples 
have to be generated, or there must be an easy way to determine if three numbers form a [Pythagorean triples](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple). 

The easy way is to check if three numbers are Pythagorean triple, by checking if ```a^2 + b^2 = c^2```, are to check the squares themselves and 
then taking the square root of the three squares to form the set. After implementing this, search for the set for which ```a+b+c=1000```.
Compute ```a*b*c``` and the problem is solved. 

My solution in Scala: 
```scala
import scala.math._
// generating a square integers
val limit = 1000
var squares: Vector[BigInt] = Vector()
for (i <- 2 to limit){
  val S:BigInt = i*i
  squares = squares :+ S
}
// searching for pythagorean triples
for (i <- 0 to squares.length-3){
  val a:BigInt = squares(i)
  for (j <- i+1 to squares.length-1){
    val b:BigInt = squares(j)
    val c:BigInt = squares(j)+a
    // if c is a square then it a^2 + b^2 = c^2 
    if(squares.contains(c) == true){
      val x2:Vector[BigInt] = Vector(sqrt(a.toInt).toInt,sqrt(b.toInt).toInt,sqrt(c.toInt).toInt)
      // checking if a + b + c = 1000
      if(x2.sum==1000){
        val ans = x2.product
        // ans = 31875000
      }
    }
  }
}
```
