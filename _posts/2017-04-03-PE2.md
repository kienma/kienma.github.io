title: Project Euler Problem 2 
--- 
### Problem 
Starting with the first two terms of the [Fibonacci sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) as 1 and 2, 
find the sum of all even Fibonacci numbers for terms in the sequence that are less than four million. 

### Solution 
To calculate the Fibonacci sequence, I implemented an approach in which each Fibonacci term ```F``` is computed once, 
and of the three calculated terms, the two greatest are added to produce the next term in the sequence. 

Here's my solution in Python.

```python
ans = 2 # first even term is 2 and is part of the sum of even terms
F1 = 1
F2 = 2
F = F1 + F2 # next term is sum of previous two
while F < 4000000:
    F1 = F2 
    F2 = F 
    F = F1 + F2
    if F%2 == 0:
        ans += F # even Fibonacci terms
print(ans) 
# ans = 4613732
```
