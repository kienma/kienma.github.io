### Problem 
From the [problem page](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5):
> What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

### Solution 
The question is asking for the least common denominator of natural numbers 1 through 20. Thus, the problem can be reduced to computing 
least common denominators (LCMs). 

To compute ```LCM(a,b)```, I used the method ```LCM(a,b)=a*b/GCD(a,b)```, implementing the Euclidean 
algorithm to determine ```GCD(a,b)```. The LCM of the set is the LCM of the greatest element and that of the elements before it. 

I assembled the individual parts in Scala and tested for the example case of numbers 1 through 10. 
```scala
  // Euclidean algorithm greatest common denominator
def gcd(a: BigInt, b: BigInt): BigInt = {
  var A = a
  var B = b
  var C:BigInt = 0
  while (B != 0){
    C = A % B 
    A = B
    B = C
  }
  return A
}
// find LCM by GCD reduction
def lcm(A:BigInt, B:BigInt):BigInt={
  if (A==1||B==1){
    return 1
  }
  val C:BigInt = A*B
  val D:BigInt = gcd(A,B)
  return C/D
}
// find LCM of naturals 1 through n
def naturalsLCM(n:BigInt):BigInt={
  var LCM:BigInt=2
  for (i <- 3 to n.toInt){
    val I:BigInt = i
    LCM = lcm(LCM,I)
  }
  return LCM
}
// test case is naturalsLCM(10) = 2520, worked
// answer is naturalsLCM(20) = 232792560
```
