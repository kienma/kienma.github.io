title: Project Euler Problem 1

### Problem 
From the problem's [Project Euler page](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1):
> Find the sum of all the [natural number] multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Solution
The search space of the problem is clear; sum the natural numbers below 1000. To define 
number *a* as a multiple of *b*, the remainder of *a* divided by *b* is zero. The formal operation
for the remainder of *a* divided by *b* is the [modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation), 
with the symbol % in Scala and Python.  

Using the functional programming aspects of Scala, the problem can be solved in one line:
``` 
>scala val ans = Vector.range(0,1000).filter(i=>i%3==0||i%5==0).sum 
ans: Int = 233168
``` 
Concise is nice, and in Scala it's very readable. 

In Python, this problem can also be solved in a readable fashion: 
```python
ans = 0 
for i in range(0,1000):
    if i%3 == 0 or i%5 == 0:
        ans += i
print(ans)
# ans = 233168
```
