title: Project Euler Problem 3

### Problem 
From the [problem page](https://projecteuler.net/problem=3):

>What is the largest prime factor of the number 600851475143 ?

### Solution 
Generate a distribution of prime numbers, and then determine the primes ```p``` that evenly divide ```600851475143```. These primes
will have a remainder of zero, so the modulus operator can be used. 

This problem is more tractable in Python because the language has no restrictions on integer size.
Python solution: 

```python
# first generating primes using  Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm
from math import sqrt
n=10000 # generate primes under 10000 
SQ=int(sqrt(n))
composites=[j for i in range(2,SQ) for  j in range(i*2,n,i)]
primes=[x for x in range(2,n) if x not in composites] 

N=600851475143
for p in primes:
    if N%p==0:
        print(p) # last prime for which this is true is the answer
# ans: 6857
```
