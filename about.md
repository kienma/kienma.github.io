Welcome! I'm Kien Malarney and I study biochemistry at UC San Diego. I also work in a microbial ecology lab and am interested in computing, chemistry, and biosciences --- especially microbes. 

Additionally, I'm a former iGEMer, a bronze medalist in 2016 with [ASIJ_Tokyo](http://2016.igem.org/Team:ASIJ_Tokyo). We investigated 
degrading PET plastic by genetically engineering *E. coli*.

Thanks for reading!
