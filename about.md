Welcome to my blog! I'm Kien Malarney and I come from an international background: 
I'm Vietnamese–American, born and raised in Tokyo, Japan, and have attended international school for most of my school years. 
I study Mandarin Chinese, too. I will begin to study molecular biology at UC San Diego this fall.

In STEM, I'm mainly interested in biology, chemistry, computer science, mathematics, and their applications. Within biology, I enjoy 
genetics and protein chemistry, especially their applications in agriculture and molecular medicine. 
In addition, I find that anthropology, ethics, history, and public health are interesting and important subjects. Intersections of topics — 
for example, of science and ethics, and of technology and society — also fascinate me. 

I like theoretical topics but also research and learning by doing. 

Additionally, I'm an iGEMer, a bronze medalist in 2016 with [ASIJ_Tokyo](http://2016.igem.org/Team:ASIJ_Tokyo). We investigated 
degrading PET plastic by genetically engineering *E. coli*. Currently, I mentor the ASIJ_Tokyo 2017 team, which is 
investigating early diagnosis of colorectal cancer through molecular genetic markers.
